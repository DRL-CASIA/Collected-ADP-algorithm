The first author (Yu Jiang) is a Software Engineer with the Controls Toolbox Team at MathWorks, and most likely will hold the same position at the time the book is published. However, it should be noted that this book is not sponsered by MathWorks. It is entirely based on the papers submitted and/or published during Yu's PhD at the New York University. The MATLAB/Simulink-based simulations were originally created during that period. Hence, they are not products of MathWorks, and do not contain any intellectual property of the company. -- Yu Jiang (12/4/2016). .
